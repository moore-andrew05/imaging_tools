### Imaging Tools

This repository contains some tools for my live bacterial imaging, especially on the spinning disc confocal using slidebook. They should make it more efficient to image and easier to read the final processed data into a database complete with metadata.

### This branch

This branch is for the analysis of the actual data so that I can keep track of what I've done for each analysis/rep.

### TODO

I have built up all the tools to do the full analysis, just need to write all the metadata to the database, should probably look into sqllite or something if I have time because reading from pickle isn't going to be ideal for people who want to use R or another language to do analysis on the data.
