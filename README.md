### Imaging Tools

This repository contains some tools for my live bacterial imaging, especially on the spinning disc confocal using slidebook. They should make it more efficient to image and easier to read the final processed data into a database complete with metadata.


### TODO

Set up sqlite database

package tools into a python package to make them easier to use going forward.
