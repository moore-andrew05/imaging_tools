Comments: N2 Grown on JUB66_RFP and JUB66_RFP_IN_CEMBIO to L4 stage @25 C. Slide Prep was good, most JUB66 MONO are young L4, could probably start run an hour later or so to get them to better stage. Will see how staging is on CEMBIO. Most of the young L4 seem to have a lot dimmer signal than do later L4s, definitely something I have observed before, a lot of worms lack signal entirely, it's all so interesting. JUB66_RFP group went really well and smooth. Hoping that the CB group goes just as well. The CEMBIO group seems very binary almost, if there is anything there there's a lot and otherwise there's nothing. Good imaging run overall. I can collect an N=10 in less than 1.5 hours if I really bust my ass and have a good prep.

image5,YL4,4, Lots of signal in this one all concentrated near posterior again,00025
image6,L4,5,Cool Worm a bit older than most of the others in this prep and sure enough had a lot more interesting signal,00026
image7,L4,5,This one is bursting with signal lots of interesting stuff. Again seems like slightly older L4s have that slightly larger lumen that makes all the difference,00027
image8,OL4,4,This guy is a bit older perhaps seeing lots of good signal near the posterior,00028

image1,YL4,4,Not much in the intestine here most of the signal coming from just behind the pharynx.,00031
image2,L4,4,This one had a decent bit of signal and whatever that DAPI autofluorescent bacteria is in the cembio community,00032
image3,L4,3,This one had that phenotype where there's a large widening of the lumen ab 100 um from the end of the intestine,00033
image4,YL4,4,comments,00034
image5,YL4,4,Not much to see here,00035
image6,L4,5,Lotsa good signal in this one,00036
image7,L4,5,Decent bit of mid-lowkey anterior signal on this one,00037
image8,L4,3,Not much going on here,00038
image9,YL4,4,comments,00039
image10,L4,4,distended posterior intestine. Good worm had to end on a swish,00040
